Module 4: Python Project


Dear Students,

Congratulations on completing the Python module! 

As a culminating project, you'll be working with a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Your tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:

Preprocessing:
Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180. Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis. (1 mark)

Analysis Tasks:
1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. (2 marks)
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company. (2 marks)
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees. (2 marks)
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. (2 marks)
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually. (2 marks)

Graphical Representation:
For each of the five analysis tasks, create appropriate visualizations to present your findings effectively. (5x2 = 10 marks)

Data Story:
Provide insights gained from the analysis, highlighting key trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset. (3 marks)

Timely Submission:
Ensure timely submission of your project to earn an additional mark. (1 mark)
Total Marks : 25

By completing these tasks, you'll not only demonstrate your proficiency in Python programming but also your ability to analyze and communicate insights from real-world data.

Findings : 

Employee Data Analysis and Insights Report

Pre-processing Steps • Loading Data: The dataset was read from myexcel.xlsx. • Handling Missing Values: o Missing Salary values were replaced with the median salary. o Missing College names were filled with "Unknown". • Fixing Height Column: o Incorrect height values were replaced with randomly generated values between 150 cm and 180 cm. • Ensuring Correct Data Types: o The Height column was converted to integer format.

Analysis Tasks Performed • Employee Distribution Across Teams: o Counted employees in each team and calculated their percentage. o Bar chart showing team-wise employee distribution. • Employee Distribution by Position: o Counted employees by position. o Bar chart displaying the number of employees in each position. • Predominant Age Group: o Grouped employees into age categories (18-25, 26-30, etc.). o Bar chart showing employee distribution across age groups. • Salary Expenditure by Team and Position: o Calculated the total salary expenditure for each team and position. o Two bar charts: one for team-wise salary expenditure and another for position-wise salary expenditure. • Correlation Between Age and Salary: o Checked if age affects salary. o Scatter plot showing the relationship between age and salary.

Graphical Representations Created • Bar Charts: Employee distribution across teams, positions, and age groups. • Salary Analysis Charts: Salary expenditure across teams and positions. • Scatter Plot: Age vs. Salary correlation.

Insights Gained • Employee Distribution Insights: o Some teams have more employees than others. o Most employees work in common positions like guards and forwards and some positions have less employees. • Age Group Trends: o Most employees fall in the 26-35 age range. o The number of young (18-25) and older (41-50) employees is lower. • Salary Trends: o Some teams spend much more on salaries than others. o Certain positions, especially key roles have higher total salary expenditures. • Age vs. Salary Correlation: o Older employees tend to earn more, but there are exceptions where some younger employees also receive high salaries.
